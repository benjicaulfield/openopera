He was the first son born to Carol (Barn)Tanzymore and Walter (Hooky) Brown. Etonne was called home on March 30, 2020 to join his grandparents, Marceline (Momma) and Richard (Tan) Tanzymore. He was their baby. Etonne was affectionately known to some as ""easy"" due to his relaxed personality.
 
 During the first few years of his childhood, he was surrounded by his female big cousins, Keishia, Trina, Taimyra and Berneatta (Candy). He hated being the only boy since he typically got into trouble because of something they set him up to participate in. When he finally became the leader of the 80's babies/cousins (that is, Stephen, Natisha, Marrchelle, Antwan, Rasheeda, Dustin, Lil Lo, Crystal, and Ciara) he definitely enjoyed the role of having male cousins to play with but most of all being a big cousin. What he loved even more was when he became a big brother to Daniel.
 
 Etonne was a person who rarely ever complained. To know Etonne was to love Etonne. He was a fun loving person who always smiled . Anyone who ever met him walked away remembering that smile that could light up any room. If there was one phrase to describe him it would be ""he was well loved"".
 
 Etonne received his education from the Baltimore City Public School System. He would often impress you with how much he knew about nature. Etonne stressed to his third and fourth generation cousins about the importance of going to school and receiving an education. Also, Etonne was gainfully employed by Holly Poultry for 10 years where he was a devoted worker.
 
 When he was a young boy, he gave his life to Christ. He was baptized at Gethsemane Baptist Church in Baltimore, Maryland. His favorite hymn was ""I'm on the Battlefield for My Lord"".

“While the officers closed in on Fincher, Fincher pointed the gun at Officer Ricardo Rivera and tried to fire it,” Hoovler said Friday. “The weapon jammed because Fincher had improperly racked it.”
Fincher started to run away and was confronted by two other city police officers. One of the officers engaged in a struggle with Fincher and was struck in his head by Fincher’s gun, Hoovler said. The other officer joined the struggle.

Police responded to the Loaf ‘n Jug located at 1019 Space Center Drive
in Colorado Springs, Colorado, regarding a robbery in which the suspect
took four or five Modelo bottled beers from the cooler and attempted
to leave without paying.
As the clerk tried to block the suspect from leaving, the suspect said he
had a gun, shoved past the clerk and left the store. The clerk, who
reported that he felt what he believed to be a gun in the suspect’s
pocket, immediately called 911. This incident was captured on Loaf ‘n
Jug’s surveillance video. Shortly after, the suspect was caught on
surveillance video walking behind the Loaf ‘n Jug toward a nearby
Waffle House. From there, a figure is seen on Waffle House video

Springs police officer, at the drive-thru window of Carl’s Jr. Hayes
opened the rear passenger door, got into the vehicle and told Lucas
Aragon, “Take me where I want to go or you’ll get hurt” and “I have a
gun.” Hayes had his hand in his jacket pocket and was pointing an
object at Aragon that appeared to be a gun. Lucas Aragon reported
that he believed it was a gun, and, thinking through what options were
available to him, he believed that his best chance to live was to shoot
Hayes. He told investigators that he didn’t believe that a lesser degree
of force was feasible because his gun was his only weapon, there was a
gun pointed at him, and that he could not use a lesser degree of force
without being shot by Hayes. Aragon, believing his life was in danger,
turned and fired his personal weapon at Hayes, striking him nine
times. He then jumped from his vehicle, reloaded and called
911. At the time he was shot, Desmond Hayes was committing Attempted

He was still living at home when he died.

“This is our baby child,” Antoine Bufford said of his son. “Can’t get rid of that last one.”

Cortez always loved fast cars. “I don’t think he knew how to drive slow,” said Monisha Merrill, his sister. His last car was a 1994 Firebird, which Antoine is trying to fix.

A “dork” with glasses who got teased in grade school, Cortez took his first job — apart from his neighborhood lemonade and hot dog stand operation — as a dishwasher at the Old Spaghetti Factory. He loved working there, his parents remember, and was upset with them when he had to quit to take a big family vacation to New Orleans. Photo ops with alligators during a swamp tour cheered him up, but it was a sore spot for years.

He would eat ice cream and watch movies with his nieces and nephews and house-sit for his sister, Ericka Freeman, who described him as her sidekick who “always went for what was right.”

Cortez later took warehouse jobs at FedEx and UPS, earning employee accolades for his forklift operation skills. But he lost his job of several years after failing a drug test for smoking weed, his father said.

One of his last jobs was working at Henry’s Funeral and Cremation Service, a business his cousin Brandon opened in late 2017.

000196,OK,Atatiana Jefferson,,Atatiana,,Jefferson,,28,Female,"Ms. Jefferson, known by her nickname Tay, was the youngest of what her family called the “A team” — four siblings whose given names all started with the letter A. She had big dreams, and worked hard to attend college at Xavier University of Louisiana, where she graduated in 2014 with a degree in biology. She hoped to one day become a doctor.

“She was part of the first generation of people in my family to go to college,” said Ashley Carr, 35, who lives in Houston and works as a budget analyst for the Houston Independent School District. “There were plenty of days of struggling, plenty of days of eating ramen noodles for dinner. But that wasn’t a deterrent for her.”

Recently, Ms. Jefferson had been selling medical equipment while studying and saving up to apply for medical school, Ms. Carr said. But after their mother got sick, Ms. Jefferson agreed to move away from Dallas, where she had been living with a roommate, to Fort Worth, where she moved in with their mother, their sister Amber Carr and Amber’s sons, who are 4 and 8.

Ms. Jefferson taught the 8-year-old how to dress himself in the mornings and get ready on time for school, and took the 4-year-old to an indoor playground for his birthday, where she showed him how to go down a slide, her family recalled. Their bond was so close, “sometimes people think that they are her kids and not mine,” Amber Carr said at a news conference this month.

Ashley Carr, who does not have children, recalled how she and Ms. Jefferson had bonded over their “fur babies,” which included Ms. Jefferson’s current brood of three cats and two dogs. The sisters also dabbled in following the stock market together. “We were like, ‘Did you see such and such went down today about 10 points?’” she said. The sisters had no money in the market, she said, “but it was just the point of, that was our camaraderie.” Atatiana Jefferson’s family and friends honored her for what she had been to them in life: a hands-on aunt who took her nephews to arcades and playgrounds; a pet lover who could not say no to animals in need, even once adopting a wild rabbit; and a pillar of family life who, at 28 years old, put her own life on pause to move in with her sick mother.

“Whoever she really cared for, she went all in for it — people and animals,” her sister Ashley Carr said. https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/24/us/atatiana-jefferson-funeral-fort-worth.html",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/24/us/atatiana-jefferson-funeral-fort-worth.html,https://fatalencounters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Atatiana-Jefferson-2.jpg,10-12-2019,1203 E Allen Ave,Fort Worth,TX,76104,Tarrant,Gunshot,Officer Aaron Dean went with several officers to investigate an open door at Atatiana Jefferson's house.

He often developed friendships with his massage clients, like April Young, who said: “He had a child-like spirit … He lived in his own little world. He was never into, like, fitting in. He just was who he was.” “He was the sweetest, purest person I have ever met,” another of his friends and former clients, Marna Arnett, added. “He was definitely a light in a whole lot of darkness.” Arnett believes that, in addition to helping manage a chronic chill that McClain attributed to his anemia, wearing a mask helped him manage his social anxiety. “He would hide behind that mask,” Arnett said. “It was protection for him, too. It made him more comfortable being in the outside world.” His mother, Sheneen McClain, described her son as incredibly determined. “I thank God that he was my son because just him being born brought life into my world, you know what I mean?” she said. “I know he was giving life to other people too.”",https://sentinelcolorado.com/news/metro/unlikely-suspect-those-who-knew-elijah-balk-at-aurora-police-account-of-his-death/,https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/3b2/9bd/ace6fc56c9e767e0b357e5398dbbaf0fc5-elijah-mclain-family-photo.rvertical.w330.jpg,09-24-2019,Billings Street and East Colfax Avenue,Aurora,CO,80011,Adams,Physical Restraint,"Elijah was walking home from picking up an iced tea for his brother when police approached him, put him in a carotid restraint stranglehold and then called in paramedics to administer ketamine.

000247,OK,Patricia Spivey,,Patricia,,Spivey,,52,Female,"Born on March 11, 1967, Patricia Ann Marshall was the fifth and only girl of proud and loving parents, Bennie and Hardie Marshall. She was a joy because after years of trying they were finally blessed with a baby girl.

Patricia attended Houston Independent School District attending Paul Lawrence Dunbar Elementary, James D. Ryan Middle School and the almighty Jack Yates Senior High School.  She was quiet but well known in the Third Ward Community with having 4 older brothers. You could catch her at Emancipation Park recreation room with her little brother Richard most summers and after school.  Her family lived directly across the street from Jerusalem Missionary Baptist Church where she became a member and accepted Christ under the leadership of Rev. David Leon Everett, II.

At the tender age of fifteen, Patricia welcomed her only child a daughter, Patrina Marshall.  For 31 years Pat and Methodist Hospital have had a harmonious relationship. Pat started in the mailroom and worked diligently and faithfully to cultivate her career. Rising through the ranks to become the Executive Administrative Assistant to the Methodist Supply Chain Manager. As the true socialite Pat was well-traveled and involved in everything! Her love for health and wellness was exemplified by her youthful appearance, which Pat attributed to her dedicated exercise routine. Her commitment to physical fitness and the well being of others is embodied by the litany of walks and runs she participated in every year. Thought she participated in dozens of runs annually she had a special connection to American Heart Association Heart Walk 5k, The Sisters Network Walk, Susan B. Komen Walk and The Houston Texas Running with the Bulls 5k. Her philanthropic side wasn't something she chose to advertise. However, she loved to party with a purpose and for over a decade helped raise money for Historically Black Colleges & Universities with the Tom Joyner Foundation's Annual Cruise.

To know Pat is to know how much she enjoyed a good theme! Like everything else in her life once she had her current trend theme she committed to it. If it was an Astros game you could guarantee that Pat had the Astros attire, belt, socks,  shoes, and her signature red lif! Being naturally generous she made sure whatever family member that accompanied her had their own matching attire! More than anything, Patricia loved her family and supported her friends. Her dedication was obvious and appeared effortless. Her father enjoyed photography as a hobby and his doting daughter followed in his footsteps. No matter the event, if Pat was there, so was her camera and her kilowatt smile. If she wasn't taking pictures then she was laying out a feast. Pat was notorious for cooking. She could grill, smother, bake and fry like no other! And was always willing to share any of her gifts and passions with others. She supported her beloved high school Jack Yates and all of her classmates.

Pat was preceded in death by her mother, Bennie Mae Marshall; grandparents Gracie Mae & Bennie Porter (maternal) and Hardy & Mary Marshall (paternal).

Pat's legacy will be honored and continued by her family her Favorite girl and only child Patrina Marshall; father Hardie Marshall, Jr. brothers Harvey, Charles, Roderick, Rodney and Richard; godchild and princess Jayla Foxx and a host of nieces, nephews family, and friends.

Patricia's robust life will be cherished by all those who called her friend, family or the lady always smiling with the camera.",https://www.owwileymortuary.com/obituary/patricia-marshall-spivey,https://s3.amazonaws.com/gunmemorial-media/photo/146309.jpg,07-28-2019,5013 Briscoe Street,Houston,TX,77033,Harris,Gunshot,"Harris County Sheriff's deputy Renard Spivey was off-duty when he called police at about 3 a.m. to report an accidental shooting at his home.

000295,OK,Miles Hall,,Miles,,Hall,,23,Male,"Miles Anthony Hall was born on February 15, 1996. He was the first born to his proud parents, Scott and Taun Hall.  Miles spent the vast majority of his life in Walnut Creek. He attended Parkmead Elementary School, Walnut Creek Intermediate School and graduated from Las Lomas High School as a member of the Class of 2014.

Miles was a brilliant self taught musician who composed beautiful music. He learned to play guitar, piano and crafted eloquent beats on his computer. He also produced music for his friends which helped them express themselves and realize their musical potential. His music was amazing and was a gift to those who heard it.

Miles was often seen riding his beach cruiser bike around his neighborhood and downtown Walnut Creek. He said he loved the feel of the wind blowing on his face and hair. His favorite destinations were Civic Park or Heather Farms where he enjoyed hanging out.

Miles was kind hearted, sweet, and had an infectious smile that would light up a room. He could walk into any room and instantly bond with people and make them feel comfortable. He was gentle, funny, and his playful spirit would constantly make his friends and family laugh. He was a beautiful soul who brought so much joy to his family, friends, and community. 

Miles had an inquisitive mind and wanted to know literally everything. The only limit to his questions was the patience of the person he was asking. His inquiring mind was never satisfied. He listened to every response to the questions he asked. However, if he didn't truly believe the response he would research or test the subject on his own until he found his own suitable answers. His friends and family quickly learned they had to answer truthfully, and often ""I don't know"" was the best you could do.

Family was very important to Miles. He spent many hours reading and discussing the Bible with his grandmother Edi, traveling with his Granny, Auntie, Happy Pappy and Grand Mommy. He spent holidays rough-housing with his cousins. He loved camping and snowboarding with his extended family of friends and neighbors. The most important person in Miles' life was his little sister Alexis. He loved her more than anything in the world and protected her at all costs. She was his best friend and their bond was unbreakable.

Miles suffered from mental illness, an affliction he battled the best he could. Unfortunately Miles lost the battle, but not to mental illness. He lost to the system that failed him. Miles lost his life in order to bring awareness to this growing problem. Mental illness is real and prevalent, but change is coming. Miles' family and friends are determined to bring about this change.

000301,OK,Terrance Bridges,,Terrance,,Bridges,,30,Male,"Bridges grew up in Chicago.He had five siblings. His sister Tierra Cox said she and her older brothers, Bridges and Raydale Davenport, were especially close. Bridges and Davenport were her protectors. They always looked out for their little sister. In 2006, Davenport was shot and killed in Chicago. The man who killed him was later sentenced to 50 years in prison. McGee said after Davenport’s death, Bridges took on the role of big brother to his siblings. Bridges would call McGee “Wonder Woman,” she said, because she would make anything happen for her children. McGee said she doesn’t feel like Wonder Woman anymore. She feels like she let him down. “That’s what I would tell people: Love your kids while you’ve got ‘em,” McGee said. “Because you never know when they’ll be gone.” Bridges loved to dance. In April last year, Bridges and McGee had a dance-off at the annual party they threw to celebrate Davenport’s life. Bridges would dance with his sister’s children too. Cox said Bridges loved to cook, especially soul food. Two of his favorite things to make were fried pork chops and macaroni, she said, but he could cook anything. Bridges wanted to be a homeowner and buy houses for Cox, McGee and his grandmother. He and Cox had a plan to succeed. It was something they had dreamed about for years. She would sell books and he wanted to start his own trucking company. “All he wanted was to make it out the projects,” Cox said. “My brother wanted something out of life.” In 2018, Bridges moved to Kansas City with his girlfriend.

Also, a baseball lover, he played for Willie Hall and Comisky Parks. After his school days, Daviri worked for Crystal Hot Sauce for a few years until he decided he wanted to be his own boss and started cutting grass in the community.

Some time after the move to Houston, he missed his hometown and decided to move back to New Orleans. He started a landscape and pressure wash business, which he named “Bop’s Landscape & Pressure Washing.” Forever the entrepreneur, Daviri also dealt with auto sales licensing and auctions and, eventually, started buying up sorry-sighted houses around New Orleans to fix up and sell. 

Daviri was a happy-go-lucky kind of person, the kind of person that had a lot of compassion. He helped those in his community who needed help with bills and school clothes. When holidays came he would buy gifts for neighborhood kids who were less fortunate. He was loved by many people and was respected as such.

000343,OK,Osaze Osagie,,Osaze,,Osagie,,29,Male,"Osaze was born on Aug. 2, 1989, in Ithaca, New York — three years to the day after his parents were engaged in a traditional ceremony in Nigeria. (They were married six weeks later in Maryland, as both Sylvester and Iyun had family members in the United States.) The couple moved to the United States in 1987 to attend Cornell University, Iyun for her Ph.D. in English and Sylvester for his master’s degree and Ph.D. in organizational behavior in the Industrial and Labor Relations School. In the summer of 1992, the family moved to State College. Their home, in an area off Westerly Parkway, was a gathering place for neighborhood children. They played badminton, croquet and soccer in the backyard, which was also equipped with a treehouse and swing set. “You couldn’t get the grass to grow because they played everything back here,” Iyun says.

Osaze was a joyful child. “He would laugh the loudest,” his mother recalls.

Sylvester remembers vividly, when his children were young, that they loved when “each time I went into their room, I jumped on a bed, and they would scream and jump on me.”

Osaze was a peacemaker. “He was a very calm boy,” Sylvester says. “Each time people were in conflict, he was the one in the middle trying to make sure that everything was settled.”

And Osaze could barely be separated from his Bible. Iyun and Sylvester didn’t have to persuade their eldest son to go to church. He did it willingly. He even attended Bible studies with them. Even as the only child there, he was an active participant.

As a teenager, Osaze was in the youth ministry at State College Assembly of God, where Pastor Zac McDonald was a youth pastor. Osaze attended weekly youth group meetings, participated in a Bible quiz program and went on trips. When McDonald and his wife launched State College Access Church five years ago, the Osagie family started attending services there.

He was a “very kind, gentle-spirited” young man, McDonald says. He always had a “big, golden smile” on his face.

Osaze would come to church early to pore over his Bible and pray. “Church wasn’t just a place that he went to; it was more than that. He had a relationship with Jesus,” McDonald remembers. “He was always talking to me about things he was reading in the Bible.”",https://www.statecollegemagazine.com/articles/remembering-osaze/,https://www.fatalencounters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Osaze-Osagie.jpg,03-20-2019,1013 Old Boalsburg Rd,State College,PA,16801,Centre,Gunshot,"At approximately 1:45 p.m. State College Police confronted Osaze Osagie at his apartment to serve him a mental health warrant.

000349,DNU,Latasha Nicole Walton,,Latasha,Nicole,Walton,,32,Female,"The life and legacy of a Queen, the beautiful Latasha Nicole Walton better know simply as (Tasha or T-Bird for fun) came into this world in the early start of autumn on September 23, 1986 she was born in Ft. Lauderdale at Broward General Hospital. She was a gorgeous, vibrant, and beautiful baby girl. Born to the parentage of Carlos Gonzales and the late amazing Brenda Lee Walton Wright who Tasha deeply cherished. After giving birth to Latasha, standing right by her side in the delivery room was her then boyfriend turned husband Alphonso Wright Sr. who took Tasha as his own and they both raised her and showered Latasha with true love, peace, joy and happiness. She admired the union they shared. Tasha was the oldest of her two siblings Allison Shemia Wright (Worm) and her brother Alphonso Wright Jr. (Man- Man). The three siblings all shared the same room, the same dreams where they laughed together, played together and often times got each other in trouble by pulling pranks and telling jokes with each other. The had an amazing childhood and over time they built this dynamic bond where they were inseparable and were one another’s best friend. She started her elementary education in the Broward County School System at Broadview Elementary on to Charles Drew Elementary School in Pompano Beach, then to Crystal Lake Middle School where she participated in many activities such as “Lady’s Intrigued” a program for young women on a mission for greatness. Finally she completed her education at Blanche Ely High School where she was well know, loved and admired by many of her classmates.Later after her education was completed as she entered into adulthood she met her first love and father to her children Lafortune Normil Sr. they spent ten years together and birth their own two bundles of joy; Lafortune Normil Jr (Nunu) who was their pride and joy; and six years later they welcomed their last amazing baby boy Jeremiah (Duke) Normil.
Shortly after living their every day life with one another they received the worst news they ever could imagined, in the late summer June 22, 2003; the family suffered a terrible loss and was completely devasted to learn their 35 year mother gained her wings and was called home to eternal life in Heaven with her Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. The three children, then 16,14 and 12 were shocked, broken and lost. Latasha did not let that break her, she was able to push through every obstacle in her way even heartbreak and she immediately became a mother to her siblings and her very own son Nunu (only 3months old at the time), she raised them all as her own by working two jobs and providing a roof over their heads.Time passed by and the three siblings remained close and intimate with each other celebrating every birthday, holiday and family vacation through out the years along with close family and friends.Latasha finally found her true love and lifelong partner in her fiancé Steve Charles who proposed to her on her birthday last year with a diamond ring. She was floored by the new engagement and was set to be married in 2020. They shared five beautiful years together and two unfortunate miscarriages due to a few complications. They mourned together and their bond grew even closer; they pushed through and spent countless hours of joy, peace and happiness in complete bliss every single day they lived side by side. She would often say “Allison I Found my husband.” Earlier this year they settled down in the beautiful and pleasant city of Boca Raton, Florida. Latasha was a phenomenalmother and aunt to her children as well as her three nephews Jayden, Arlo and Mason and one niece Breonna, she would often say. She loved and provided for them like her own, she would always remind me saying “Sis I’m going to work hard and provide a lifestyle better than we had growing up for all of us” and she meant just that. Tasha was an active, kindhearted mother: every morning she would wake them up, dressed her children, fixed them breakfast and drive them to and from school. She loved being a mother and aunt; her nephews and niece would often say she was the world’s greatest because she would give them anything they asked for and every thing she did was full of love and was done with a pure heart. The kind of heart she had was bigger than life and to see other people happy was always her priority. She did the same for every single person in her family, a countless number of friends, and even strangers she would just meet. She loved and she loved hard and anyone that knew her around the world can attest to the fact that she was a class act. She adored FAMILY and Friends and just wanted the best for everyone around her. As time passed she grew into her own wisdom of what she wanted for herself and began her professional career and became her own Boss and opened her own business of distributing hair/wigs and other beauty products. Her small business was excelling and she was so proud of her future endeavors to expand.

Whether it was creating videos, opening for Jadakiss, writing a new rhyme, or just dropping a few bars off the top in the park; music was always on his mind. Always taking on a new business venture ranging from bails bondsman, selling cars, to rehabbing houses.
Kyron was always fresh and loved to dress, quick to give a nickname, loved the kids as they also loved him back, and could make anyone laugh even on your worst day. His smile was amazing and if you happened to be one of the fortunate ones you was blessed to see it for yourself. He also enjoyed grilling & relaxing by the bonfire.
Kyron was a loving and caring person. He loved his family, his friends and his community ""Rose City"", but his older brother Keith was his world.

000368,OK,Willie McCoy,,Willie,,McCoy,,20,Male,"Before he was killed, McCoy wanted to make music about police brutality, being pulled over by the police, the violence he saw in his community, but also the joy.

“The music that he made was just all about the struggle, and trying to identify himself with everyone that walked in the same footsteps as him,” said Damariee Cole, McCoy’s nephew.

“Everybody has a skill, and his skill was music,” Cole said. “He wanted everybody to understand his background and where he came from; his struggle, and letting everybody know that, you know, you can come out of poverty and be something.”

McCoy grew up in Sacramento and Vallejo. He was in Sacramento until his father died of mesothelioma when he was about 11 years old. He moved to Vallejo to live with his mom. About two months later, she died of breast cancer, said Harrison.

“He had a good culture to him you know,” Harrison said. “Willie was raised by the village by all of the family and the whole community.” Since McCoy’s death, members of his rap groups have struggled to stay motivated.

“Willie was a leader,” he said. “Sometimes we didn't want to do projects or go to the studio or write rhymes. Willie was always writing when there was no beat. He would be right in his car and he would have a full song already written out with no beat. So, when you lose a leader with somebody that's given us that extra motivation, you know, it's hard to continue.”

It’s also hard to be around everyone else in the group. It’s a reminder of who’s not there.

000619,OK,Mark Daniels,,Mark,,Daniels,,39,Male,"Mark Anthony Daniels was a shy, introverted child. Dr. Spock from Star Trek was his hero. Through Fellowship of Christian Athletes and a high school football coach, he became a world changer through his love for people. To strangers, Mark was warm, kind and compassionate, with a winning smile. To his family, he was their “road dog”, their “gray baby”, their wise counsel, their loyal son/brother/uncle who loved to laugh but learned to cry. To his friends, he was born for adversity, always available and determined to confront whatever life would bring. Many described him as a gentle giant, faithful, caring, with a heart made of pure gold. To Vanessa he was her other half, her “holy of holies person”, her bestie, protector, lover, flesh of her flesh…bone of her bone. They were inseparable soul mates, evidenced in his last words…to her: “I love you.”

Isaiah was well-known for his impeccable athletic ability on the football field and the basketball court. He was the starting point guard and quarterback for Huffman High School, where he was honored as Most Valuable Player for both sports. It was at Huffman High School where Coach Steve Ward took Isaiah under his wings and began to mold him into an awesome athlete and a respectable young man. Coach Ward played a very pivotal role in Isaiah’s life; he was not only his coach but he was a friend and took on the role of a father-figure to Isaiah. Coach Ward was a great mentor, and Isaiah truly loved him.
Isaiah was not just athletically inclined; he was the true definition of a student athlete. He graduated Huffman High School in the Top 10 of his class and scored a 28 on the ACT his first time taking the test. He was an extremely intelligent young man. His athletic and academic gifts awarded him honors in scholarship offers totaling $1.2 million.
Following graduation, Isaiah received and accepted an academic scholarship to LaGrange College in Georgia, where it did not take long for his athleticism to prevail. During his time there, Isaiah was named Rookie of the Week and Player of the Week. The next year, he transferred to Lawson State Community College, where he was a member of the Men’s Basketball Program. In 2015, he graduated with Honors and received his Associate Degree in General Studies. Isaiah then received a full athletic scholarship to Miles College, where he attended in the Fall of 2015.
Isaiah was loved by so many and left a lifelong impression with all who knew and loved him. His smile lit up a room and brightened the day of anyone he encountered. He was blessed with a genuine love for people. He left with us memories of his humble, silly, and beautiful spirit.

Mattioli got into an altercation with Acevedo and used a chokehold on him, according to the criminal complaint filed in May.
Acevedo died in the hospital 6 days later.
Mattioli told police, according to the criminal complaint, that he woke up the morning after the party, which Acevedo had attended, to find Acevedo going through the pockets of the pants Mattioli was wearing.
Mattioli told police he confronted Acevedo and told him to leave, and then Acevedo punched another person in the house, according to the complaint. That's when Mattioli subdued Acevedo on the floor with his arm around Acevedo's neck, the complaint says, and called 911.
When officers arrived, Acevedo wasn't moving, the complaint says. Mattioli insisted he had not choked Acevedo.
